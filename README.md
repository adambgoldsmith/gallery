## Welcome to the Gallery. 

The Gallery is a creative and engaging game that blends technology and artistry. 
Draw on four mini canvases while listening to soothing music, and let your imagination take the lead. 
Each canvas features a button that sends your sketch to a machine learning model, which analyzes and identifies your creation, sharing its interpretation with you. 
Once all four sketches are complete, head to the main canvas and press the 'Generate' button. 
This triggers another machine learning model that combines your drawings into a single AI-generated masterpiece. 
It's a fun and innovative experience that turns your ideas into art!
